    If you're interested in contributing to the Compass Component library built by Mattermost, we
    welcome your involvement. This information will help you get started.

## Introduction

**Compass Components** is a shared component library used to build appealing user interfaces from scratch with ease.
It's based on the Mattermost Design style guide called the **Compass Design System**.

## First steps

When you are viewing this guide on our deployed setup start with [step 1 (clone)](#Step 1), otherwise you can skip
the first few steps and directly start from [step 2](#step-2)

### Step 1 - Clone

To start contributing to the Compass Component library you need to first fork and checkout the codebase from the git
repository. This can be done in one of two ways:

-   via the GitHub CLI (`gh`)
-   via github.com

There is a very sophisticated step-by-step guide on the GitHub docs on
[how to fork and clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
Here are two abbreviated ways to fork and clone the repository.

#### Option A: `gh` CLI

1. [Install the CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) tools following the setup steps in the README.
2. Follow [these steps](https://cli.github.com/manual/) to authorize it with your GitHub account.
3. Move to the folder where you want the repository to be cloned into (we will use `~/github` as an example):

```bash
cd ~/github
```

4. Fork the Compass Components repository by running the following command in your
   terminal:

```bash
gh repo fork mattermost/compass-components --remote --clone
```

5. The repository is now being forked to your GitHub account and cloned into the subdirectory `compass-components`.
   GitHub offers a convenient feature to automatically create a remote `upstream` repository for you to update your fork
   from the current state of the official repository.

#### Option B: using github.com

1. Go to the [Compass Component Repository](https://github.com/mattermost/compass-components) and select the **Fork**
   option in the top right corner of the screen:

    {' '}
    <img src={forkImg} alt={'fork button on github UI'} />

2. In GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Compass Components repository.
3. Above the list of files, select the green **Code** option, then select either **HTTPS** or **SSH** and copy the
   string from that field.
4. Navigate to the folder where you want the repository to be cloned (we will use `~/github` as an example):

```bash
cd ~/github
```

4. Clone the repository into this folder:

```bash
git clone <COPIED_STRING_FROM_STEP_3>
```

5. Once the repository is cloned into the subdirectory `compass-components`, add the official repository as an
   `upstream` remote to keep it up-to-date:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mattermost/compass-components
```

    If you read this you show interest in contributing to the Compass Component library built by
    Mattermost. You are very welcome to do so and this is where we will get you started.

## Introduction

**Compass Components** is a shared or common component library to build appealing UIs from scratch with ease.
It is based upon the Mattermost design style guide called **Compass Design System**.

## First steps

When you are viewing this guide on our deployed setup start with [step 1 (checkout)](#Step 1), otherwise you can skip
the first few steps and directly start from [step 4](#step-4)

### Step 1 - Checkout

To start contributing to the Compass Component library you need to first fork and checkout the codebase from the git
repository. This can be in one of 2 ways:

-   via the GitHub CLI (`gh`)
-   via github.com

There is a very sophisticated step-by-step guide on the github docs on [how to fork and clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
but we all have way too many tabs open too manage another one, right? So here is a very brief guide as well.

### Step 1.1 - `gh`

1. [install the CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) tools following the setup steps in the README.
2. follow [these steps](https://cli.github.com/manual/) from the CLI manual to authorize it with your GitHub account.
3. move to the folder where you want the repository to be cloned into (we will use `~/github` as an example):

```bash
cd ~/github
```

4. If everything is set up we can start by forking the Compass Components repository by running this command in your
   terminal:

```bash
gh repo fork mattermost/compass-components --remote --clone
```

5. the repository is now being forked to your account and cloned into the subdirectory `compass-components`.A really
   convenient feature of the github CLI is, that it automaatically creates a remote `upstream` for you to update your fork
   from the current state of the official repository.

### Step 1.2 - using github.com

1. got to the [Compass Component Repository](https://github.com/mattermost/compass-components) and click the fork button
   in the upper right corner of the screen:

    {' '}
    <img src={forkImg} alt={'fork button on github UI'} />

2. on GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Compass Components repository.
3. Above the list of files, click the green Code button and select either **HTTPS** or **SSH** and copy the string from
   the field.
4. move to the folder where you want the repository to be cloned into (we will use `~/github` as an example):

```bash
cd ~/github
```

4. now you can clone the repository into this folder:

```bash
git clone <COPIED_STRING_FROM_STEP_3>
```

5. the repository is now being cloned into the subdirectory `compass-components`.
6. add the official repository as an `upstream` remote to keep it up to date:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mattermost/compass-components
```
